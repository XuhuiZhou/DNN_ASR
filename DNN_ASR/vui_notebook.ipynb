    "### (IMPLEMENTATION) Final Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've tried out many sample models, use what you've learned to draft your own architecture!  While your final acoustic model should not be identical to any of the architectures explored above, you are welcome to merely combine the explored layers above into a deeper architecture.  It is **NOT** necessary to include new layer types that were not explored in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you would like some ideas for even more layer types, check out these ideas for some additional, optional extensions to your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you notice your model is overfitting to the training dataset, consider adding **dropout**!  To add dropout to [recurrent layers](https://faroit.github.io/keras-docs/1.0.2/layers/recurrent/), pay special attention to the `dropout_W` and `dropout_U` arguments.  This [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287) may also provide some interesting theoretical background.\n",
    "- If you choose to include a convolutional layer in your model, you may get better results by working with **dilated convolutions**.  If you choose to use dilated convolutions, make sure that you are able to accurately calculate the length of the acoustic model's output in the `model.output_length` lambda function.  You can read more about dilated convolutions in Google's [WaveNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499).  For an example of a speech-to-text system that makes use of dilated convolutions, check out this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet).  You can work with dilated convolutions [in Keras](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/) by paying special attention to the `padding` argument when you specify a convolutional layer.\n",
    "- If your model makes use of convolutional layers, why not also experiment with adding **max pooling**?  Check out [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02720.pdf) for example architecture that makes use of max pooling in an acoustic model.\n",
    "- So far, you have experimented with a single bidirectional RNN layer.  Consider stacking the bidirectional layers, to produce a [deep bidirectional RNN](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/asru_2013.pdf)!\n",
    "\n",
    "All models that you specify in this repository should have `output_length` defined as an attribute.  This attribute is a lambda function that maps the (temporal) length of the input acoustic features to the (temporal) length of the output softmax layer.  This function is used in the computation of CTC loss; to see this, look at the `add_ctc_loss` function in `train_utils.py`.  To see where the `output_length` attribute is defined for the models in the code, take a look at the `sample_models.py` file.  You will notice this line of code within most models:\n",
    "```\n",
    "model.output_length = lambda x: x\n",
    "```\n",
    "The acoustic model that incorporates a convolutional layer (`cnn_rnn_model`) has a line that is a bit different:\n",
    "```\n",
    "model.output_length = lambda x: cnn_output_length(\n",
    "        x, kernel_size, conv_border_mode, conv_stride)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of models that use purely recurrent layers, the lambda function is the identity function, as the recurrent layers do not modify the (temporal) length of their input tensors.  However, convolutional layers are more complicated and require a specialized function (`cnn_output_length` in `sample_models.py`) to determine the temporal length of their output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to add the `output_length` attribute to your final model before running the code cell below.  Feel free to use the `cnn_output_length` function, if it suits your model. "
